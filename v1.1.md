## Explain version-1.1 Codes

### Next()

1. We can see that we have to handle err every time from catch block in every controller file in the project. We can handle this error very easily through the express mechanims named next()
2. If we give anything into next() in express application it treated as error. And next() pass it to global error handler.
3. Global error handler is a error handling middleware. And is have 4 parameters named: req, res, err, next.
4. Controller catch block => next() => global error handler

### Not Found (middleware)

1. If we give a wrong api then express gives us a html template formate error. We use this middleware to convert that html formet into json formet. It takes 3 parameters like a normal middleware.

### sendResponse utility function

1. We have to use response from the try catch block in controller.ts file. That's why our code repeatation increases gradually. So we can easily create a common reuseable function for that called utility function. And we can call it from the controller.ts file and send out required data.

### Index Route

1. This just a refactoring of application routes. This refactoring will help us to manage multiple routes and clean code in app.ts. Actually it will also help us to manage the route in modular pattern.

## Explain version-1.2 Codes

### Higher Order Function

1. A function that takes a function as a parameter, do some tasks and retuen a function.

### catchAsync utility Higher Order function

1. We use try-catch block many times in the controller.ts file. It increase out code repeatation. So that's why we will use this function.
2. catchAsync receives a asynchronous code. And we know that asynchronous code will return a promise. We will call that asynchronous function from catchAsync and keep that asynchronous code into Promise.resolve so that that asynchronous code can resolve easily.
3. For any reason that code unable to resolve we use .catch() and pass the error through next(). next() will take the error from global error handler. Because we know that we can pass error to global erorr handler through next()

### RequestHandler

1. It's a express type that help us to declare request handling function in express application. If we use this we do not import Request, Response and NextFunction every time from express.

### validateRequest

1. It is a middleware and also a higher order fucntion. It takes zod validation schema as a parameter. Check data type before going to controller.
2. For checking data asynchronously it use zod parseAsync mechanism. If all ckecking is okay it calls next(). If there is any mistake for checking the type it goes to catch block and call next(err).
